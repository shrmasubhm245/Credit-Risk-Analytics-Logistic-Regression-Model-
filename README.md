Developed a predictive model to identify customer defaulters, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 78%. Successfully predicted 54 defaulters out of 150 new customers.
Separate the new and existing customers and then build a model based on the existing customer data. Use this model to predict defaulters among the new customers.
Steps in model building:
i) Perform Train-Test-Split
ii) Reduce variables using Somers'd score
iii) Check for multi-collinearity using VIF
iv) Define and fit the model
v) Assess model accuracy
vi) Determine the best cut-off point for final predictions
vii) Validate the model using decile analysis
viii) Make predictions on the new customer data
